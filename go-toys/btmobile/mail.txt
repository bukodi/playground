Hi Dimtry,

I tested the new version, but it has the same problem.

I extracted the Redemption64.dll from Redemption64.zip, and registered it with regsvr32 command.
I'm using the same code that I sent previously.
The RDOEncryptedMessage.GetDecryptedMessage() function throws the same exception as before:
 "Failed to get the Recipients Certificate needed to decrypt the message".

I checked the Version property of the RDOSession object, and it is "6.6.0.6318"

Thanks,
László Bukodi
